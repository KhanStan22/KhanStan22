- 👋 Hi, I’m @KhanStan22
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code and all things associated with building computers and what computing can do!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on Khan Academy, which recommended I create a Github site.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I have few to no skills (for the moment) and want to learn everything. Thanks for help and suggestions!
